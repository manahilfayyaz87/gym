                <h2>Our Story</h2>
                <p>IRON FORGE was founded in 2015 with a simple mission: to create a gym that puts people first. We started as a small fitness facility with just a handful of dedicated members and two passionate trainers. What began in a 2,000 sq ft space has grown into a state-of-the-art 15,000 sq ft facility serving over 2,000 active members.</p>
                <p>Our founder, Michael Peterson, envisioned a space where people of all fitness levels could come together to achieve their goals. He believed that with the right equipment, expert guidance, and a supportive community, anyone could transform their body and their life.</p>
                <p>Today, IRON FORGE stands as a beacon of excellence in the fitness industry. We continue to invest in the latest equipment, training methodologies, and member services to ensure our community thrives.</p>
